            <p> 
                Look carefully or you’ll miss them! Eastern fence lizards have great camouflage for living in forests. They lie in wait for 
                creatures like insects and spiders to get close before springing into action and swallowing them. 
                 <div class="fun-fact"><strong>FUN FACT</strong>: You can tell the difference between males and females by their patterns. 
                    Males have blue swatches on their underside while females have black stripes on their backs.

                These little guys are very adaptable, and can live in forests, savannas, fields, and even sandy dunes! They are little carnivores, 
                eating mainly insects, but also enjoying the occasional mollusk.
                 <div class="fun-fact"><strong>FUN FACT</strong>: These lizards  have long tails that help them speed away from predators. If caught, 
                    they can lose their tails to distract or confuse whatevers trying to eat them!

            <p> 
                Known for their bite, the Snapping Turtle is omnivorous, meaning they consume both plants and other animals. Their diet varies depending on their age,
                habitat, and availability of prey. They can grow from 8 to 20 inches in length, with males being larger that the females.
                 <div class="fun-fact"><strong>FUN FACT</strong>: Contrary to popular belief, Snapping Turtles are only temperamental
                    during the breeding season.

            <p> 
                These turtles don’t spend a lot of time out of water, but when they’re out they love the Sun! They are found in the mountains 
                and live in bodies of water with a sandy or muddy floor. They eat fish, and crawfish, frogs, and worms.
                 <div class="fun-fact"><strong>FUN FACT</strong>: In order to hunt, these creatures bury themselves up to their neck and attack passing fish. 
                    They look like little eels sticking out of the mud. Peek-a-boo!

            <p> 
                Adding to the list of colorful creatures on this website, the Red Corn Snake isn’t actually all red. They are diverse in color ranging between red to yellow 
                with gray or black markings. Like most snakes these guys eat mice and other rodents. 
                 <div class="fun-fact"><strong>FUN FACT</strong>: The longest living corn snake in captivity was 32 years old!

            <h1 class="card-title">QUEEN SNAKE</h1>
            <p> 
                These snakes are water snakes, living primarily along the banks of rivers and ponds in shrubs and grasses. They often eat crawfish, occasionally eating tadpoles and small fish. 
                It’s one of two snakes in the Regina taxonomy, the other being Graham's Crayfish Snake.
                 <div class="fun-fact"><strong>FUN FACT</strong>: The queen snake’s common name may have originated from its latin name “Regina Septemvittata”; “Regina” meaning “queen” in latin. Go Gina!
