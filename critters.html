            <h1 class="card-title">ISABELLA TIGER MOTH</h1>
                <p> 
                    Also called Woolly Bears in their larval state,
                    Isabella Tiger Moths can be found in meadows all across WNC,
                    along with other locations such as Southern Canada and Mexico.
                    Their diet mainly consists of garden plants like honeysuckle, 
                    sunflowers and echinacea, better known as coneflowers.
                    As of 2024, they are not at risk of endangerment, meaning they
                    are least concern.

            <p> 
                Usually found in forests and fields, the Six Spotted Tiger Beetle feasts
                on a variety of different arthropods including ants, crickets, grasshoppers
                and even other beetles. They can be identified by their bright green color, 
                and while their name says otherwise, they can actually have anywhere from 0 
                to 6 spots on their wings. As of 2024, they are considered least concern for endangerment.

            <p> 
                Choosing to build their nests in damp or decaying wood like dead trees,
                Carpenter ants don’t actually eat wood. Their diet actually includes a 
                variety of sweets like honey, syrup and sugar. Along with nesting in decaying
                wood, they also set up satellite nests, spreading their colonies over a large 
                area. As of 2024, they are not at risk of endangerment. Least concern.

            <p> 
                As their name suggests, Stink Bugs can be quite smelly. They tend to reside in 
                narrow spaces such as peeling bark or cracks in floorboards, and if they are squashed, 
                they release a strong, long lasting odor. Their diet mainly consists of fruits and vegetables 
                including apples, berries, corn and peppers. As of 2024, they are considered least concern for 
                endangerment.

                About ¼ of an inch and a brownish gray color, Coppery Leafhoppers can be found 
                anywhere that supports vascular plants, but for WNC, that's limited to mostly forests. 
                Their diet includes the sap from many different plants such as flowers, grasses and fruit trees. 
                As of 2024, they are not at risk for endangerment. Least concern.

            <p> 
                Choosing to live in prairies and meadows, Monarch Butterflies love to eat the nectar located in the flowers
                that they drink from. The Monarch Butterfly eats the nectar through a body part, called the proboscis, that extends 
                from the butterfly's mouth. In WNC, they are common along the Blue Ridge Parkway.
                As of 2024, they are threatened of becoming endangered in the near future, as they are Threatened. 
                <div class="fun-fact"><strong>FUN FACT</strong>: They migrate annually to parts of California and Mexico.
