            <p> 
                There’s anywhere between 9,000-11,000 of these guys scattered across NC. 
                They settle in forested areas which makes WNC a hotspot for them. Black 
                bears eat fruits, nuts, plants, carrion, and bugs. Critters beware!

                    than mountain black bears because they don’t have to hibernate as long. Mountain

            <p> 
                The River Otter is a small mammal that lives in lakes, forested areas, 
                and- you guessed it- rivers! Once hunted to near extinction they can now 
                be found in almost every county in NC. These cuties are carnivores; Hunting 
                down mollusks, fish, crustaceans, birds, amphibians, and reptiles.
                <div class="fun-fact"><strong>FUN FACT</strong>: River Otters have a second 
                    set of eyelids to help them see underwater more clearly. It’s like having 
                    built-in goggles!

                Graceful, elegant, and hunted down to a population of ~1000 in the 1900s; 
                there's around 1 million White-tailed Deer in NC today! These deer have a diet 
                that changes with the year- Preferring leaves, fruits, nuts, and mushrooms 
                in more abundant seasons, and relying mainly on twigs and tree bark in Winter.
                <div class="fun-fact"><strong>FUN FACT</strong>: White-tailed Deer are ruminants 
                    which means they have 4 stomach chambers. Imagine how much you could eat with 
                    a 4-chambered stomach! Yummy!

            <p> 
                The Gray Bat is a species in trouble. There used to be ~2.5 million in the 1970’s, 
                but now only around 480 are left. These little balls of fuzz like to live in limestone caves. 
                These caves are often damp, leading to the bats getting sick. Gray bats love to eat bugs, but 
                their absolute favorite are Mayflies. Yuck!
