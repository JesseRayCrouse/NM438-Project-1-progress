            <h1>What is <br> WNC's Creature Corner?</h1>
            <p>WNC's Creature Corner is a website that is focused on providing others with 
               educational content that is centered around the wildlife of Western North Carolina. 
               The wildlife here is very biologically diverse, and the education of wildlife and
               wildlife conservation are core themes we want to spread to others in our community.

            <h1>Why is it important <br> to conserve wildlife?</h1>
            <p>Wildlife conservation is very important because our local ecosystems directly benefit 
                us too if we take care of them. Our local wildlife is unique, and the thought of losing
                iconic species in our ecosystem would be a very sad sight. Our local wildlife are just
                as essential to our ecosystem as we are, so it's very important to respect and conserve
                our respective environments.

                type of wildlife. The button located in the top right of the screen leads to the How to Help 
                page, which features local wildlife and environmental organizations. Ranger Owen hangs out in
