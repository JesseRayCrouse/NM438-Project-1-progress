            <p> 
                Also called spotty for short, Spotted Bass can be found in clearwater streams and rivers, 
                choosing to avoid natural lakes. Their diet includes a variety of different species such as 
                insects, frogs and even other fish. In Western North Carolina, they are considered at risk of 
                endangerment due to habitat degradation.

            <p> 
                Usually found in dams, the Sicklefin Redhorse is distinguishable from other redhorses thanks to their curved dorsal fin. 
                They like to eat benthic macroinvertebrates, which are very small aquatic animals with no backbones, like worms and crustaceans. 
                Sicklefin Redhorse are listed as a threatened species in Western North Carolina, but are protected.
                <div class="fun-fact"><strong>FUN FACT</strong>: They can live up to 20 years!

            <p> 
                Actually appearing more silver, the White Crappie tend to enjoy their time in warmer waters,
                opting to reside in mud-bottomed pools and creeks. Their diet changes throughout their development, 
                starting with plankton and shifting to insects and smaller fish later in their lives. They are currently 
                considered least concern for endangerment in WNC.

                Unlike the White Crappie, Rainbow Trout choose to spend their time in colder waters such as cool streams, 
                lakes and estuaries. Compared to other types of trout, Rainbows aren’t as shy about their feeding time, 
                feasting on both aquatic and terrestrial insects in broad daylight. They are considered least concern for
                endangerment in WNC.

                Mayflies, an aquatic insect resembling a dragonfly, are the Tangerine Darter’s main food source. It is currently not 
                considered at risk of endangerment.

                They can grow to be over 4 feet long, and tend to be one of the bigger fish in their ecosystem.
                They prefer to live in logjams and deep runs located in these rivers.
